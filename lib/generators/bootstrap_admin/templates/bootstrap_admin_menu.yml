# This is where you can define the bootstrap admin menu.
# Menus can only have 2 levels (root level and secondary level [for dropdown menu entries]).
# You must supply a list of menu entries.
# To do that, you can use this set of options
# :label - the label that will be presented in the menu
# :class - the css class to apply to the item
# :url   - the url to be used on the item link.
# :item  - one of 3 things: a String, an Array or a Symbol
#          * String: must be a name of a model. The supplied model will be used to build
#                    the link url, as well as the label if not supplied
#          * Array:  This will indicate that the item is in fact a dropdown menu. In this case
#                    :label MUST be supplied.
#          * Symbol: currently only ":divider" is supported and produces a division between
#                    dropdown elements. In this case, both :label and :url will be ignored
#
#
# Examples:
# * Simple menu item based on a known model
# - :item: Document
#
# * Simple menu item based on a model with a custom label and a custom css class
# - :item: Author
#   :label: The guys who done things
#   :class: really_bold
#
# * Simple menu item based on a model with a custom url
# - :item: Search
#   :url: "https://google.com"
#
# * Dropdown menu item with several options and a divider
# - :label: "User Administration"
#   :url: "#"
#   :item:
#   - :item:  Role
#   - :item:  :divider
#   - :item:  User
#     :label: Dudes
