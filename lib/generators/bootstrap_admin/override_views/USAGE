Description:
  Allows you to override the default views for all bootstrap_admin actions, either globally or resource specific.
  If you choose to override globally, then all views for all resources will be overridden.
  If you choose to override for a specific resource, then your overrides will only affect that resources' views.

Example:
  $ rails g bootstrap_admin:override_views defaults
    This will:
      1) Create app/views/admin/defaults folder
      2) Copy all of bootstrap_admin default views to that folder for you to tweak
    From there on, all resources will use these views.

  $ rails g bootstrap_admin:override_views defaults index new
    This will:
      1) Create app/views/admin/defaults folder
      2) Copy all index and new related views to that folder for you to tweak
    From there on, all resources will use these views to render index or new actions.

  $ rails g bootstrap_admin:override_views books
    This will:
      1) Create app/views/admin/books folder (if it doesn't exist already)
      2) Copy all of bootstrap_admin default views to that folder for you to tweak
    From there on, only book resources will use these views.
